- Clone in clound9 with a blank template
- sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install octave
- Set DISPLAY acording to https://community.c9.io/t/how-to-set-display-in-my-workspace/1646/19, which uses https://github.com/shadowcodex/c9.ide.desktop:
- c9 install c9.ide.desktop
- sudo apt-get install websockify
- Go to Cloud9>Preferences>Experimental>SDK and enable the two toggles for "Load Plugins From Workspace" and "Load Custom Plugins."
- Then use "Start Desktop" and "Open Desktop" under the View menu
- I'm not able to actually interact with the Desktop, but I can display things on it using "export DISPLAY=:99"
